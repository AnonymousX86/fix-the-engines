# Contributing

1. This is my first game project so don't expect anything to be best quality, but I'm open to improvements.
2. If a method won't be used outside of a class - it's private then.
3. Localization is now lowest priority, all PRs will be closed, and probably not re-opened later.
4. Try to contribute only to [`world.py`](https://github.com/AnonymousX86/fix-the-engines/blob/main/FTE/world.py), other things are strictly associated with narration.
5. New plot-twist will be probably immediately closed. All the storyline is created in closed group.
